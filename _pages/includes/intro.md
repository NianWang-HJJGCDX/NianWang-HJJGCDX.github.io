From 2022.03, I am an PhD candidate at Xiâ€™an Research Institute of High-tech, Shaanxi, China.

His researches focus on machine Learning (deep Learning) and its applications to image processing, computer vision and data mining. My current interests includes image dehazing, data clustering (classification) and object recognition (tracking). I have published 20+ papers <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=i2Ots7kAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?logo=Google%20Scholar&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.jsdelivr.net%2Fgh%2Fwangsiwei2010%2Fwangsiwei2010.github.io@google-scholar-stats%2Fgs_data_shieldsio.json&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a> about above topics on some international conferences and journals.

Now I am severing as a reviewer for IEEE TIP, TMM, TCSVT, SPL, pattern recognition and knowledge-based systems etc. 


I am now working on ***Multi-modal Data Analysis***, ***Scalable Unsupervised Learning*** and ***LLM Agent Planning***. I have published 50+ papers <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5o9hK3EAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?logo=Google%20Scholar&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.jsdelivr.net%2Fgh%2Fwangsiwei2010%2Fwangsiwei2010.github.io@google-scholar-stats%2Fgs_data_shieldsio.json&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a> at the top international AI conferences and journals, such as NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, CVPR, ICCV, AAAI and IEEE TPAMI, TIP, TKDE, TNNLS. I also serve as Area Chairs for top conferences, including ICLR, NeurIPS, ICML, CVPR, AAAI and ACM MM.
